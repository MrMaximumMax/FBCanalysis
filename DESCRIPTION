Description: The package includes tools for performing fluctuation-based 
    clustering (FBC) on biological time series data, primarily for monitoring 
    data fluctuations in asthmatics. The package includes functions for 
    registering and processing time series data, developing matching clustering 
    models based on Earth Mover's distances, and evaluating the models through 
    enrichment analysis, stability after random data removal, or other frequently 
    used cluster stability metrics.
