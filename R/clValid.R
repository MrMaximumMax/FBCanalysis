#' Interactive console workflow to calculate and evaluate cluster validation measures
#' which have been determined previously by the call \link{init_clValid}.
#'
#' @param matrix Earth Mover's Distance Matrix for processed patient time series data (also see functions: \link{emd_matrix}, \link{patient_list})
#' @param par Object of type list storing clustering methods and cluster range of interest; initialized via function: \link{init_clValid}
#'
#' @return Object of type list storing chosen clustering method and number of clusters (can be then used for function \link{clust_matrix})
#'
#' @import clValid
#' @import RankAggreg
#'
#' @details The call guides through an interactive workflow and generates cluster
#' evaluation measures, stores and lists, visualizes corresponding plots and lets
#' the user decide which technique is the prefered one. Once the user has chosen
#' his favourite, the flow continues to the function \link{clust_matrix} and generates
#' the respective clustering output. The internal cluster validation methods utilize
#' just the dataset and the clustering partition as input and evaluates the
#' clustering’s quality by using intrinsic information included in the data.
#'
#' The call calculates Connectivity, Silhouette width and Dunn index. Connectivity
#' describes the connectness to neighbors of particular clustering partition and
#' should be minimized. Silhouette width defines the average silhouette value for
#' each observation and should be maximized. The Dunnn index is a definition for
#' Ratio of shortest distance between non-cluster observation and greatest intra-cluster
#' distance and should be maximized likewise.
#'
#' Furthermore, cluster stability measures are available, namely Average proportion
#' of non-overlap (APN), Average distance (AD), Average distance between means (ADM)
#' and Figure of merit (FOM). APN is the average proportion of observations that are
#' not clustered using complete and leaky data. AD defines the average distance in
#' observations for both complete and leaky data. ADM deals with the average distance
#' between cluster centers in complete and leaky data. FOM is a measure for average intra-
#' cluster variance in leaky data. All measures should be minimized. Furthermore,
#' Rank Aggregation may be performed. It approaches to provide a generic and flexible
#' framework for objectively integrating several ordered lists in a suitable and
#' efficient way. The used technique for evaluating clustering the rank is by a
#' Cross-entropy approach, which is incorporating Spearman’s footrule distance measure.
#' In the end a recommendation for the best fitting clustering model is given.
