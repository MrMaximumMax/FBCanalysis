\details{
Hierarchical clustering describes a general agglomerative hierarchical
clustering approach in which the optimum value of an objective function is used
to choose which pair of clusters should merge at each step (see \link{hclust} for
more details).

K-means clustering is a vector quantization technique that divides
a set of n observations into k groups, with each observation belonging to the cluster
with the closest mean or centroid (see \link{kmeans} for more details).

The divisive analytic method (DIANA) constructs a hierarchical clustering structure,
starting with a single huge cluster containing all n observations. Clusters are further
split until each has a single observation. At each step, the cluster with the
largest diameter is selected, where the diameter of a cluster is defined as the
biggest difference between any two of its observations (see \link{diana} for
more details).

While partitioning around medoids (PAM) is comparable to k-means, it is considered
more robust since it allows for the use of dissimilarities other than euclidean
distance. As with k-means, the number of clusters is determined in advance, and
an initial set of cluster centers is required to begin the process (see \link{pam}
for more details).

Clustering large applications (CLARA) is a system that involves sampling to apply
PAM to a sequence of sub-datasets. When the number of observations is big, this
results in shorter run times. It is substantially faster than other partitioning
algorithms such as PAM at handling huge datasets. Internally, this is performed by
examining fixed-size sub-datasets, which results in linear rather than quadratic
time and storage requirements for n (see \link{clara} for more details).

FANNY explains a fuzzy analysis clustering method. Each observation is distributed
through-out the numerous groups in a fuzzy clustering (see \link{fanny} for more
details).

Self-organizing maps (SOM) are a widespread unsupervised learning technique used
by com- putational biologists and academics in machine learning. SOM is a neural
network-based system that is well-known for its ability to map and display
two-dimensional data (see \link{SOMclustering} for more details).

Modelbased clusterinng fits the data to a statistical model composed of a finite
mixture of Gaussian distributions. Each mixture component represents a cluster,
and the maximum like- lihood method, or estimation maximum (EM), is used to
determine the mixture components and group memberships (see \link{ModelBasedClustering}
for more details).

SOTA, self-organizing tree algorithm, denotes an unsupervised network with a
hierarchical and divisive binary tree topology. It is a fast approach, which
makes it suitable for clustering a large number of elements. It combines the
advantages of hierarchical clustering with those of SOMs. The algorithm chooses
the most diverse node and separates it into two nodes referred as cells (see
\link{sota} for more details).
