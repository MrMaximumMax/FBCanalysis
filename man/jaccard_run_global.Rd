approach}
\usage{
jaccard_run_global(
  plist,
  parameter,
  n_simu,
  method,
  clust_num,
  n_clust,
  range,
  maxIter,
  normalize
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plist}{Object of type list storing patient time series data (also see function: \link{patient_list})}

\item{parameter}{Parameter of interest in time series data list}

\item{n_simu}{Number of simulations}

\item{method}{Clustering method (also see function: \link{clust_matrix})}

\item{clust_num}{Cluster of interest}

\item{n_clust}{Number of clusters}

\item{range}{Range to simulate random data removal (e.g. c(0.1,0.2,0.5,0.7,0.8))}

\item{normalize}{Indicates if parameter indicated needs to be normalized or not (TRUE by default)}

\item{Iter}{Maximum iterations to determine Earth Mover's Distances (also see function: \link{emd_matrix});
default is 5,000 for this function}
}
\value{
Object of type list storing Jaccard indices for each indicated random data removal step and visualized results in a boxplot
}
\description{
Simulate amount of random data removal from time series data list and determine
Jaccard index via Global Cognate Cluster approach for multiple random data removal
steps for a specific cluster of interest.
}
\details{
See \link{sim_jaccard_global} for more detailed approach on Jaccard
index determination. The difference in this function is that now only one cluster
is observed für multiple amounts of random data removal where for each data
removal step defined the resulting Jaccard indices are stored in a list object.
Furthermore, a boxplot visualization is generated, in the style of recent
publications.
