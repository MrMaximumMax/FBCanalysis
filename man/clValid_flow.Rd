\title{Cluster validation measure analysis workflow}
\usage{
clValid_flow(matrix, par)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{Earth Mover's Distance Matrix for processed patient time series data (also see functions: \link{emd_matrix}, \link{patient_list})}

\item{par}{Object of type list storing clustering methods and cluster range of interest; initialized via function: \link{init_clValid}}
}
\value{
Object of type list storing chosen clustering method and number of clusters (can be then used for function \link{clust_matrix})
}
\description{
Interactive console workflow to calculate and evaluate cluster validation measures
which have been determined previously by the call \link{init_clValid}.
}
\details{
The call guides through an interactive workflow and generates cluster
evaluation measures, stores and lists, visualizes corresponding plots and lets
the user decide which technique is the prefered one. Once the user has chosen
his favourite, the flow continues to the function \link{clust_matrix} and generates
the respective clustering output. The internal cluster validation methods utilize
just the dataset and the clustering partition as input and evaluates the
clustering’s quality by using intrinsic information included in the data.

The call calculates Connectivity, Silhouette width and Dunn index. Connectivity
describes the connectness to neighbors of particular clustering partition and
should be minimized. Silhouette width defines the average silhouette value for
each observation and should be maximized. The Dunnn index is a definition for
Ratio of shortest distance between non-cluster observation and greatest intra-cluster
distance and should be maximized likewise.

Furthermore, cluster stability measures are available, namely Average proportion
of non-overlap (APN), Average distance (AD), Average distance between means (ADM)
and Figure of merit (FOM). APN is the average proportion of observations that are
not clustered using complete and leaky data. AD defines the average distance in
observations for both complete and leaky data. ADM deals with the average distance
between cluster centers in complete and leaky data. FOM is a measure for average intra-
cluster variance in leaky data. All measures should be minimized. Furthermore,
Rank Aggregation may be performed. It approaches to provide a generic and flexible
framework for objectively integrating several ordered lists in a suitable and
efficient way. The used technique for evaluating clustering the rank is by a
Cross-entropy approach, which is incorporating Spearman’s footrule distance measure.
In the end a recommendation for the best fitting clustering model is given.
