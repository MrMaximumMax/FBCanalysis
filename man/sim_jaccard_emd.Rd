\description{
Simulate random data removal for a removal amount with indicated
number of simulations from time series data list and determine Jaccard
index for all clusters via Earth Mover's distance cluster assignment
approach.
}
\details{
This method represents a novel approach and potential complementary
method to \link{sim_jaccard_cognate}. First, clustering is performed on complete
data without removal, servinng as Gold Standard clusters. For every Gold Standard
cluster then, all time series data from all patients is z-normalized and then
assumed to be as one Gold Standard distribution. Subsequently, random data is
removed form the time series data. Each leaky data distribution is then compared
via Earth Mover's Distance to each Gold Standard Distribution. The Gold Standard
cluster distribution to which the observed leaky distribution exhibits the
lowest Earth Mover's Distance gets the assignment. This process is repeated until
every leaky time series data distribution is assigned to a cluster. Afterwards,
the Jaccard indices are calculated, comparing cluster members with complete
and leaky data, for each cluster.
