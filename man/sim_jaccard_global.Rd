\description{
Simulate random data removal for a removal amount with indicated
number of simulations from time series data list and determine Jaccard
index for all cluster via Global Cognate Cluster cluster assignment approach
}
\details{
The cognate cluster approach works in the manner that first a Gold
Standard cluster is determined meaning the cluster assignments without any
data removal. Subsequently, random data is removed from the original, complete
data and clustering is performed again on the leaky data. The cluster determined
to be cognate to the Gold Standard cluster is the one with the highest overlap
in cluster members, meaning hte cluster with highest acheived Jaccard index.
Afterwards, the Jaccard indices are calculated, comparing cluster members
with complete and leaky data, for each cluster.
